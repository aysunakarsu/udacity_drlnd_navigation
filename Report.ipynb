    "This project's aim is to train a reinforcement learning agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a restricted environment. A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  \n",
